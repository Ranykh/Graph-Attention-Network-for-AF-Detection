# Graph-Attention-Network-for-AF-Detection
This repository hosts resources for "Graph Attention Networks for Atrial Fibrillation Detection." It explores GATs to model inter-lead ECG dependencies and regional variations, featuring WMI-based graph construction, region-specific adaptations, and advanced validation techniques for arrhythmia detection.
