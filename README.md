# Graph Attention Networks for Atrial Fibrillation Detection in ECG Signals


##  Overview

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and a leading cause of stroke and heart failure worldwide. In this project, we propose a deep learning framework that leverages **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)** to detect AF from 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Unlike traditional models, our method captures **inter-lead spatial dependencies** and **geographic variations**, significantly improving the modelâ€™s diagnostic capabilities.

This project was conducted using datasets from three geographically distinct populations (China, Germany, and the US) and integrates advanced statistical methods and visualizations to analyze cross-regional generalization.

## Deep Learning & GATs: A Brief Introduction

Traditional deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs perform well on grid-structured or sequential data. However, they struggle to capture **complex interdependencies** between signals from different ECG leads.

**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** address this limitation by treating ECG leads as nodes in a graph and modeling their relationships as weighted edges. Specifically:

- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)** aggregate information from neighboring nodes but treat all connections equally.
- **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)** extend this by assigning **dynamic importance (attention weights)** to each connection using multi-head attention, allowing the model to **prioritize diagnostically relevant lead relationships**.

##  Key Features

- **Accuracy**: 94.8%
- **Recall**: 88.57%
- **ROC-AUC**: 97.28%
- **Region-aware modeling**: Adjusts for geographic biases in ECG datasets using region-specific weights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Combines statistical (mean, variance, skewness) and clinical (QRS duration, P-wave amplitude) features per lead.
- **WMI Graphs**: Graph edges are created using **Weighted Mutual Information (WMI)** to capture non-linear inter-lead dependencies.



## Features

- **Preprocessing:** Signal filtering, feature extraction (statistical and clinical), and graph representation of ECG data.
- **Graph Neural Networks:** Implementation of GATs with multi-head attention for dynamic inter-lead dependency modeling.
- **Region-Specific Analysis:** Techniques for addressing geographic variability in ECG datasets.
- **Validation Methods:** Cross-region validation, statistical testing, and dimensionality reduction using t-SNE.


## Datasets

This study uses public ECG datasets:

- **Chapman-Shaoxing** ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ (China) - 5000
- **PTB-XL** ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª (Germany) - 5000
- **Georgia 12-Lead** ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (USA) - 5000

Each contains 12-lead ECG recordings labeled for arrhythmias, particularly AF. We analyzed cross-region generalization using both baseline and region-weighted models.

## Evaluation Metrics

| Model         | Accuracy | Recall | ROC-AUC |
|---------------|----------|--------|---------|
| Random Forest | 87.6%    | 6.3%   | 71.2%   |
| GAT (5L-4H)   | 94.8%    | 88.6%  | 97.3%   |

**Cross-region tests** showed significant accuracy drops, which were mitigated using region-specific weighting strategies.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visual Insights

- **t-SNE Plots**: Visualized embeddings showed distinct clusters per region.
- **Confusion Matrix**: High precision and recall for both AF and normal classes.
- **Heatmaps**: Revealed degradation in model performance across regions and improvements after applying regional weights.
